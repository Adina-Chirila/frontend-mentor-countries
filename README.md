## The challenge

Your challenge is to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

Your users should be able to:

-   See all countries from the API on the homepage
-   Search for a country using an `input` field
-   Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
-   Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder.

In this challenge, you will find mobile and desktop designs in light and dark mode color schemes for both pages.

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

There is a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
